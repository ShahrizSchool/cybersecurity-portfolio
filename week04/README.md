# Week 04 — Logs & Evidence (Defense Thinking)

## Objective
This week focused on understanding how Linux systems record activity through logs and how defenders use those logs as evidence to detect suspicious behavior and reconstruct events.

## Linux Log Types Overview

Linux systems generate multiple types of logs, each serving a different investigative purpose:

### Authentication Logs
- Track user login attempts and privilege escalation
- Primary source for detecting unauthorized access
- Example location: `/var/log/auth.log`

### System Logs (Syslog)
- Record system service activity and general system events
- Useful for identifying service failures or unexpected restarts
- Example location: `/var/log/syslog`

### Kernel Logs
- Capture low-level system and hardware activity generated by the Linux kernel
- Include driver messages, hardware events, and kernel errors
- Typically reviewed when investigating system instability, crashes, or kernel-level attacks
- Accessed using:
  - `dmesg`
  - `/var/log/kern.log`
  - `journalctl -k`

Kernel logs are generally not the first log reviewed during access investigations, but they become important when malware, rootkits, or system crashes are suspected.

## What Defenders Look For

**Authentication Logs**
- Failed login attempts
- SSH access from unfamiliar IP addresses
- Privilege escalation activity

**System Logs**
- Unscheduled restarts
- Service failures or errors
- Unauthorized configuration changes

## Digital Forensics Mindset

When analyzing logs, defenders treat each entry as potential evidence and ask:

- What happened?
- Who performed the action?
- When did it occur?
- Why does it matter from a security perspective?

This approach helps transform raw logs into meaningful investigative timelines.

## Reflection
This week demonstrated that effective defensive security relies on understanding system behavior and recognizing abnormal patterns. Authentication logs provide strong early indicators of compromise, while other logs add context as investigations expand. Building timelines from logs reinforced how defenders analyze evidence and make informed decisions.
